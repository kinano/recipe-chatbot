4. **Combine dry ingredients:** In a separate bowl, mix the almond flour, baking soda, and salt.

7. **Pour into pan:** Transfer the batter into your prepared loaf pan. Smooth the top with a spatula.

8. **Bake:** Place the loaf in the preheated oven and bake for about 50-60 minutes. Check for doneness by inserting a toothpick in the center; it should come out clean.

9. **Cool:** Once baked, allow the bread to cool in the pan for about 10 minutes. Then, transfer it to a wire rack to cool completely before slicing.

10. **Serve:** Slice and enjoy! This bread is delicious toasted with almond butter or fresh fruit.

**Tip:** Store leftovers in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days or refrigerate for longer freshness. You can also freeze slices for future convenience.

   While waiting, prepare your berries. If using frozen berries, let them thaw slightly. For fresh berries, wash and pat dry. You can also mash some berries to add flavor and color to the pudding.

4. **Combine and Serve**  
   After the chia pudding has thickened, give it a good stir. Spoon the pudding into small bowls or glasses. Top with the berries, and if desired, add a few more whole berries on top for garnish.
