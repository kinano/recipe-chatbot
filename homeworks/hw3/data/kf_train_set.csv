1. **Soak the Cashews:** Drain the soaked cashews and rinse them thoroughly under cold water.

2. **Blend the Ingredients:** In a high-speed blender or food processor, combine the soaked cashews, almond milk, lemon juice, apple cider vinegar, minced garlic, Dijon mustard, salt, and black pepper.

3. **Process Until Smooth:** Blend on high until the mixture is completely smooth and creamy, scraping down the sides as needed. This may take about 2-3 minutes. If the mixture is too thick or stiff, add a little more almond milk, one tablespoon at a time, until achieving your desired creaminess.

4. **Add Flavor Enhancements (Optional):** For a smoky touch, blend in the smoked paprika or mix it in after blending for a more rustic appearance.

5. **Taste and Adjust:** Taste the cheese spread and adjust the salt, lemon, or vinegar to enhance the flavor as needed.

6. **Chill:** Transfer to a container and refrigerate for at least 1 hour to allow flavors to meld.

7. **Serve:** Spread on crackers, bread, or use as a dip for veggies. Garnish with chopped fresh herbs if desired.

**Tips:**  
- This cheese keeps well in the refrigerator for up to 4 days.  
- For a firmer consistency (more like a slicing cheese), transfer the mixture to a small mold or container and refrigerate until firm.

1. **Prepare the Zucchini Noodles:**

2. **Cook the Aromatics & Tomatoes:**
   - Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat.
   - Add the minced garlic and cook for about 30 seconds until fragrant, being careful not to burn it.
   - Toss in the cherry tomatoes and cook for about 2-3 minutes until they soften slightly but still hold their shape.

3. **Sauté the Zucchini Noodles:**
   - Add the drained zucchini noodles to the skillet with the garlic and tomatoes.
   - Cook gently for 2-3 minutes, stirring frequently, until the noodles are just tender. You want to keep some crunch and freshness.

4. **Finish & Serve:**
   - Remove from heat. Sprinkle the grated Parmesan cheese over the noodles.
   - Add the chopped basil, and season with salt, black pepper, and red pepper flakes if using.
   - Toss everything gently to combine and serve immediately.

### Serving suggestion:
Plate the zucchini noodles hot, garnished with an extra sprinkle of Parmesan and basil. This dish pairs beautifully with a glass of crisp white wine or sparkling water with lemon.
