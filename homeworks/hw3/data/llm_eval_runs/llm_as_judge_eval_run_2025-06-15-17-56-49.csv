This dish is savory, satisfying, and perfect for two servings.

### Ingredients:
- 2 bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 4 garlic cloves, minced
- 1 teaspoon dried thyme
- 1 teaspoon dried rosemary
- 1 teaspoon paprika
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
- 2 cups Brussels sprouts, halved
- 1 large sweet potato, peeled and cut into 1-inch cubes
- Optional: fresh parsley for garnish

### Instructions:

1. **Preheat the oven** to 400°F (200°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper for easy cleanup.

2. **Prepare the chicken:**  
In a small bowl, combine the minced garlic, dried thyme, dried rosemary, paprika, 1 tablespoon of olive oil, salt, and pepper. Mix well to form a paste.  

Rub this herb mixture all over the chicken thighs, ensuring you cover both sides and under the skin if possible.

3. **Prepare the vegetables:**  
In a mixing bowl, toss the halved Brussels sprouts and sweet potato cubes with the remaining 1 tablespoon of olive oil, salt, and pepper until evenly coated.

4. **Arrange on the baking sheet:**  
Place the chicken thighs, skin side up, on the prepared baking sheet. Surround them with the prepared vegetables.

5. **Roast:**  
Bake in the preheated oven for about 40-45 minutes, or until the chicken skin is crispy and the internal temperature reaches 165°F (75°C). The vegetables should be tender and slightly caramelized.

6. **Serve:**  
Let the chicken rest for 5 minutes. Garnish with chopped fresh parsley if desired. Serve each person a chicken thigh with a generous helping of roasted Brussels sprouts and sweet potatoes.

### Tips:
- For extra flavor, add a squeeze of lemon juice over the chicken before serving.
- You can substitute or add other vegetables like carrots or broccoli if you have them on hand.

I'm vegan but I really want to make something with honey - is there a good substitute? i am craving a yogurt breakfast,vegan,"Absolutely! For a vegan breakfast similar to a yogurt bowl, you can use plant-based yogurt such as coconut, almond, or soy yogurt. Instead of honey, I recommend using maple syrup or agave nectar, both of which are natural, vegan sweeteners that will add that touch of sweetness without compromising your dietary choices.

Here's a delicious vegan ""Yogurt and Fruit Parfait"" recipe (serves 2):

**Ingredients:**
- 2 cups plant-based yogurt (coconut, almond, or soy)
- 2 tablespoons maple syrup or agave nectar
- 1 cup mixed fresh fruits (berries, sliced banana, or diced mango)
- 1/4 cup granola (preferably gluten-free if needed)
- 2 tablespoons chopped nuts (almonds, walnuts, or pecans)
- Optional: a sprinkle of chia seeds or hemp seeds for extra nutrition

**Steps:**
1. **Sweeten the Yogurt:** In a small bowl, combine the plant-based yogurt with the maple syrup or agave nectar. Stir well until the sweetener is evenly incorporated. This will mimic the honey's natural sweetness.

2. **Prepare the Fruits:** Wash and cut your chosen fruits into small, bite-sized pieces.

3. **Assemble the Parfaits:**
   - Take two glasses or jars.
   - Spoon a layer of sweetened plant-based yogurt into the bottom of each.
   - Add a layer of mixed fruits on top of the yogurt.
   - Sprinkle a layer of granola over the fruits.
   - Repeat the layers until the glasses are filled, finishing with a layer of yogurt on top.

4. **Finish and Serve:** Garnish with chopped nuts and optional seeds for added crunch and nutrients. Serve immediately for a fresh, delicious breakfast.
