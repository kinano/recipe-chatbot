Gluten-free pizza dough that actually tastes good and isn't cardboard,gluten-free,"Certainly! Here's a delicious gluten-free pizza dough recipe that’s flavorful, satisfying, and not cardboard-like. It’s perfect for a crispy yet tender crust and serves 2 people.

**Ingredients:**
- 1 1/2 cups gluten-free all-purpose flour (preferably one that contains xanthan gum; if not, add 1/2 teaspoon xanthan gum)
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano or Italian seasoning (optional for flavor)
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1/2 cup warm water (about 110°F/43°C)
- 1 teaspoon honey or sugar
- 1 teaspoon apple cider vinegar

**Instructions:**

1. **Prepare the yeast mixture:** In a small bowl, combine the warm water, honey, and apple cider vinegar. Stir gently until the honey dissolves. Let it sit for about 5 minutes until slightly frothy, indicating the yeast activation.

2. **Mix dry ingredients:** In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour, baking powder, salt, and herbs if using. This ensures everything is evenly distributed.

3. **Combine wet and dry:** Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients. Pour in the activated water mixture and olive oil.

4. **Form the dough:** Using a spoon or a spatula, mix until the ingredients come together. The dough will be slightly sticky but manageable. If it feels too wet, sprinkle in a bit more flour; if too dry, add a teaspoon of water at a time.

5. **Knead briefly:** Lightly flour a clean surface and turn out the dough. Gently knead it for about 1-2 minutes until smooth. Since it's gluten-free, avoid over-kneading; just ensure it’s well combined.

6. **Roll out the dough:** Place a piece of parchment paper on a baking sheet. Transfer the dough onto it and shape it into a circle about 10-12 inches in diameter. You can use a rolling pin or your hands to spread it out evenly.

8. **Add toppings:** Remove from oven, add your favorite sauce, cheese, and toppings.

9. **Final bake:** Return the pizza to the oven and bake for another 10-15 minutes, until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly.
